		<p>Emmanuel and Magdaline Stopper were spending their  vacation on the Mafia Island (Chole Shamba) in Tanzania with their uncle named Dr. Kenpa Msombi who goes simply by Dr. K. Emmanuel and Magdaline were very happy to visit their uncle since they had never been in a island or been in Tanzania before. As they arrived Emmanuel went to swim and he was nearly attacked by a Sea Monster and managed to get way. Dr. K’s assistant, a huge muscular graduate student named Alexander was serving up lunch to the children (chicken salad and sandwiches).Emmanuel overheard a private conversation between Dr. K (his uncle) and five representatives for the Marine Zoo. The Zoo representatives wanted Dr. K to find and trap a mermaid that was reported in the area. The Zoo offered Dr. K the princely sum of one million dollars.</p>

		<p>Emmanuel was too excited to sleep, so he went out early the next morning at 6:00 AM to search for the mermaid. Emmanuel’s night swimming is suddenly interrupted by a hammerhead shark that almost killed him. Fortunately, the mermaid came and attacked the shark, saving Emmanuel’s life .Dr. K nets up both Emmanuel and the mermaid and draged them onto the deck of the ship. Emmanuel tried to argue that the mermaid saved his life. But the mermaid was put into a large glass tank on the deck until the Zoo crew arrived. Emmanuel was enjoying dreams of Sea People when his slumber was interrupted by the sound of crashes and a splash. Above deck, he discovered the mermaid was in the process of being kidnapped. The men brutally toss Emmanuel into the tank. Emmanuel started to yell for Alexander as Dr. K was being knocked out on the floor and Magdaline was offering no help against the four burly men. Finally, Alexander does show up only to side with the thugs.</p>
			
		

		<p>The guy tossed Magdaline and Dr.K into the tank, lock it, and threw it into the water. The top of the tank was meshed, so the three characters inside the tank fight to break the locks before the tank submerged completely underwater. As they struggle, the “kidnappers” and Alexander speed off with the mermaid in tow. Just when things became worst, a myriad of mermaid appear and hoist the tank above the water level. Dr. K and the children break open the latches and follow them to the kidnappers’ boat in their boat. As the other mermaid rescue her, the thugs set fire to Dr. K’s boat. Emmanuel and Magdaline try to put out the fire when the mermaid was set free.</p>

		<p>Suddenly, one of the men grabbed the Emmanuel and Magdaline while another men tried to hit Dr. K in the stomach but missed. The men then threw Dr. K, Emmanuel and Magdaline in the still a flamed boat, as ordered by Alexander, when the Emmanuel and Magdaline extinguish the fire, despite a thug having kicked their bucket into the ocean. One of the men tried to lower himself into the boat but the mermaids started violently rocking the boat, allowing Dr. K and the kids to escape. The next morning, Dr. K lied to the Zoo representatives about not finding the mermaid. Soon after they left, Dr. K, Magdaline and Emmanuel all swore to never talk about the mermaid again. Despite all of this, Emmanuel sneaked out to the coral again in the hope of catching the mermaid to say goodbye.When Emmanuel was searching for the mermaid, he was attacked by the Sea Monster which he encountered in the beginning of the story. He was afraid to see it again.</p>
