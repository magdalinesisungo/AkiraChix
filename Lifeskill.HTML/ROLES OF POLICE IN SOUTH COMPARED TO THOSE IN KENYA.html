<br>THE ROLES OF POLICE IN SOUTHAFRICA COMPARED TO THOSE IN KENYA<br> 



<br>The book explains about Immorality Act in South Africa that prohibit the Europeans, native and other acts in relation. The author describes how the apartheid system of government was designed to pit the many tribes of indigenous South Africans against each other, particularly the Zulus “warriors”) and the Xhosa( “thinkers”), the tribe to which his mother belonged, which is similar to Kenyan Government where  there is apartheid system especially during politics and other leadership like school committee board.<br>

<br>Noah say’s people were encouraged to snitch. It was a police state, so there were police everywhere. There were undercover police; there were uniformed police. The state was being surveilled the entire time, you know, communications were monitored and anyone could snitch which is also similar in to Kenyan police especially traffic police who only know of snitching people’s money. They tend to be good and yet they snitch and add corruption in the government.<br> 



<br>He also quotes that if it could be your neighbor, if you were living in a white area; it could be your neighbor if you were living in a black area. A lot of black people worked with the police as snitches. ... They were afforded special privileges, they may have been paid by the police, but you never knew who was informing on you which is likewise to Kenyan police who encourage or forces some people in a community and societies to be spy and snitch to others.<br>

<br>As the child of a black mother and a white father in apartheid-era South Africa, Daily Show host Trevor Noah was the living, breathing evidence that a crime had been committed. Under apartheid, interracial couples who had engaged in sexual relations could be punished with years-long prison sentences, and biracial children like Noah could be taken away from their parents. As a result, Noah spent much of his early life in hiding. This is similar to Kenya mostly in Government most our leaders during politics where by some leaders sent the police to treat people according to their tribes.<br>


<br>Most of the bad characters that happen in both Kenya and South Africa are caused by tribalism and corruption which is lack of respect to each other.<br>
