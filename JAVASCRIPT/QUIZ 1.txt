UNDEFINED AND NULL
Undefined means a variable has been declared but has 
not yet been assigned a value.

  Null is an assignment value, it can be assigned 
to a variable as a representation of no value.
 Also, undefined and null are two distinct 
types: undefined is a type itself (undefined)
 while null is an object.
