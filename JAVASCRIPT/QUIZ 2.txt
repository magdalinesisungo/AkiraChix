DECLARATION, DEFINITION AND INITIALIZATION
Declaration is creating a variable with the var keyword in JS , whereby after the declaration, the variable has no value(technically it has the value of undefined).
Example;     var car

 Initialization is the way of assigning an initial
 value to a variable. So undefined is the initial 
value of a declared variable.
Where a variable is declared it is automatically
 initialized.
Example; var thing = “code”;
The variable thing is initialized with “code”.

Definition is asking complier to allocate 
memory or define storage for that variable
